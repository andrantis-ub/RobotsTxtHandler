# RobotsTxtHandler

This handler supports Robots.txt file for Episerver. Specially if you have multi-site and want to support robots.txt.

Roadmap:
- Support web.config to override all sites config. This is usable on UAT environment
- Support default robots.txt so if site does not have custom robots.txt fall back to default
- On page level want to support exclude
- Improve admin area
- Suport analytics data:
-- When bot contacted system
-- Which bot contacted system
- Support to have different robots.txt for different language
- Support to have different robots.txt for different device
